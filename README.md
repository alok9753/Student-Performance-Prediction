# Student-Performance-Prediction
The Student Performance Prediction project is a Machine Learning model designed to predict student performance based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, previous grades, and other relevant features. This project utilizes Python and popular Machine Learning libraries to build a model that can forecast a student's potential academic performance.

Features:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: The project includes a data collection phase where student data is gathered, followed by preprocessing to clean and format the data.
Model Building: Using algorithms like Linear Regression or Random Forest, the project predicts the studentâ€™s score based on the input features.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its reliability.
User Input Interface: A simple interface (such as a web form or command-line tool) where users can input student details to get performance predictions.
Visualization: Data visualizations to represent the analysis and predictions, showing insights like the correlation between features and performance.

Technologies Used:

Python for building and training the machine learning model.
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data and results.
